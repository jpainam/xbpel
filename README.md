The aim of this work is to extend the BPEL language to support complex control flow patterns. The specific objectives are to:
i.	Propose xBPEL as an extension of BPEL to support complex control flow patterns;
ii.	Implement a prototype of xBPEL;
iii.	Propose an xBPEL engine architecture for allowing xBPEL integration into existing BPEL engines.
